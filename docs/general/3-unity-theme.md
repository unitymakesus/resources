# Unity Theme
Our Unity starter theme is built off of the Roots' theme, [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/), which bills itself as a WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow.

Our (core theme)[https://github.com/unitymakesus/starter-template] should always be installed on projects. This includes all of the components needed for WordPress. It includes a bunch of options for the header, base styling and color options, and several widget areas. Core follows the Sage theme pattern for file organization.

When creating a new project, you should use the child theme and only customize that. This way, when we update the core theme, changes won't be lost. If you need any additional functionality, you should use a `functions.php` file in the root of the child theme.
