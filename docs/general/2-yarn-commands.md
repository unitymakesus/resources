# Yarn Commands
Here are some helpful Yarn commands if you are new to Sage and Yarn. Run these script commands within your theme directory:

`yarn start` - Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browersync session. Do this when you are actively working and compile Sass or JS files.

`yarn build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory. Do this when you are pushing to a staging site.

`yarn build:production` — Compile assets for production. Do this before pushing to a live site or before launch.


For more information, consult the [Sage docs](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-development-and-building/)
