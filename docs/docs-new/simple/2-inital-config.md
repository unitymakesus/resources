# Initial WP Settings & Config
These are the steps you should take anytime a new Simple website is set up.

## Setting up content
1. Delete "Hello World!" post and empty trash.
2. Delete "Sample Page" page and empty trash.
3. Create new page, title it "Home" and hit publish.

## Media > WP Smush
1. Enable automatic smush
2. Enable full-size image resizing

## Settings > Excerpt
The length of the excerpt here depends on the individual website's design. For now, make sure the following settings are configured:

1. Check "Read More Link." The text that is here is determined by the individual website's design too.
2. Uncheck "No Custom Excerpts"
3. Uncheck "Filter: the_content()"
4. Strip Tags: Switch to "Remove all tags..." and don't check any boxes below.

## Required Plugins
The following plugins should be installed and activated on every website. Depending on the individual website's functionality requirements, other plugins may be necessary. Some of these plugins might be network activated so there is no need to reinstall.
